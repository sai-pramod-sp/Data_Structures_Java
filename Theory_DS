Binary Search Tree
--------------------------------------
Inorder-Precessor : if we are deleting an node in the binary search tree take the bigger node from the
                    left side of the tree and replace it with the deleting node
Inorder-successor : if we are deleting an node in the binary search tree take the smaller node from the
                    right side of the tree and replace it with the deleting node
