Binary Search Tree
--------------------------------------
Inorder-Precessor : if we are deleting a node in the binary search tree take the bigger node from the
                    left side of the tree and replace it with the deleting node
Inorder-successor : if we are deleting a node in the binary search tree take the smaller node from the
                    right side of the tree and replace it with the deleting node

Inorder traversal:
-----------------------
Follow (left, root, right)
